		<p>What is "version control", and why should you care? 
			Version control is a system that records changes to
			a file or set of files over time so that you can 
			recall specific versions later. For the examples in 
			this book you will use software source code as the 
			files being version controlled, though in reality
			you can do this with nearly any type of file on
			a computer.
